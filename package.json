  "readme": "# The most powerful Timing node for Node-Red\n\n#Purpose\nBigTimer is a powerful timing node offering a range of timing facilities for Node-Red and can be used singly or in groups. Full support for dusk/sunset dawn/sunrise and variations also day/week/month control and the node offers outputs to MQTT, speech and databases. You can also manually over-ride the UTC time setting on the host computer if required.\n\n#Usage\nSuitable for general use, BigTimer has 3 outputs, one of which triggers when there is a change and presents one of two messages (for, for example MQTT or other control mechanism), the second is a simple 1 or 0 every minute in the payload but also has additional outputs reflecting the status message in msg.state and message time. There is also a msg.name available  - and the third outputs a message which could be used for speech or debugging.\n\n#Inputs\nIt also has an input. This can be used to override the schedule - valid commands in the payload are \"on\", \"off\",\"default\" and more detailed in the blog - \"default\" leaves the timer to it's own devices and can also be used as an instant test.\n\n#Override\nThe manual override will time-out after 8 hours and go back to auto (just in case you forget to turn something off). Manual override will also be over-ridden by any scheduled change. There is a pause schedule button for convenient longer-term pausing of the schedule.\n\n#Special Days\nRecent additions include special days (i.e. 25/12) and special weekdays (i.e. first Tuesday of the month).\n\n\n#General\nNote - if upgrading to a later version of BigTimer - check your settings. More information on BigTimer and a range of home-control-related projects can be found at http://tech.scargill.net\n\n\n\n"
